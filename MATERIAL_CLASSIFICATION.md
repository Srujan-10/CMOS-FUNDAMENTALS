# Material Classification Based on Energy Gap and Semiconductor Types

This repository demonstrates material classification based on energy gaps and includes an explanation of **n-type** and **p-type** semiconductors.

## Theory

Materials are classified based on conductivity.

### Conductivity 
- It is a property to calculaet how much a material can withstand electricity.
- It can also be defined as a measurement of how easily a material allows electrons current to flow through it.
  
| **Material**      | **Conductivity(S/cm)**             | **Type**              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Conductor         | ≈ 10<sup>3</sup>                   | High conductivity     |
| Semiconductor     | 10<sup>3</sup> - 10<sup>-4</sup>   | Moderate conductivity |
| Insulator         | 10<sup>-4</sup> -10<sup>-18</sup>  | Low conductivity      |

### Energy Gap Classification
The energy gap (bandgap) of a material determines whether it is a conductor, semiconductor, or insulator:

| **Material**      | **Energy Gap (eV)** | **Type**              |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Conductor         | ≈ 0                 | High conductivity     |
| Semiconductor     | 0.5 - 3             | Moderate conductivity |
| Insulator         | > 3                 | Low conductivity      |

### n-Type Semiconductor
- Doped with donor impurities (e.g., phosphorus in silicon).
- Provides extra electrons, increasing electron concentration.
- Electrons are the majority carriers; holes are the minority carriers.

### p-Type Semiconductor
- Doped with acceptor impurities (e.g., boron in silicon).
- Creates holes by accepting electrons, increasing hole concentration.
- Holes are the majority carriers; electrons are the minority carriers.
