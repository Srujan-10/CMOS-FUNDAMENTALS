# Material Classification Based on Energy Gap and Semiconductor Types

This repository demonstrates material classification based on energy gaps and includes an explanation of **n-type** and **p-type** semiconductors. The project uses Python for classification and visualization.

## Theory

### Energy Gap Classification
The energy gap (bandgap) of a material determines whether it is a conductor, semiconductor, or insulator:

| **Material**      | **Energy Gap (eV)** | **Type**              |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Conductor         | â‰ˆ 0                | High conductivity      |
| Semiconductor     | 0.5 - 3            | Moderate conductivity  |
| Insulator         | > 3                | Low conductivity       |

### n-Type Semiconductor
- Doped with donor impurities (e.g., phosphorus in silicon).
- Provides extra electrons, increasing electron concentration.
- Electrons are the majority carriers; holes are the minority carriers.

### p-Type Semiconductor
- Doped with acceptor impurities (e.g., boron in silicon).
- Creates holes by accepting electrons, increasing hole concentration.
- Holes are the majority carriers; electrons are the minority carriers.
